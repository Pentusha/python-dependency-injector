The sole purpose of this fork is to publish a package that supports python3.12 and python3.13.
Like the author of the original library, I don't have a lot of free time right
now, and I'm not sure that I can keep this fork up to date.

Please use the [documentation](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/) of the original library.

I also suggest looking into the excellent [that-depends](https://github.com/modern-python/that-depends) library, 
which replicates much of the functionality of the current one.
